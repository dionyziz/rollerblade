\appsection[A Consensus Application]\label{sec:consensus}

One way to run \rollerblade is with an overlay consensus protocol.
In this construction, each overlay party acts as a validator.
Since each overlay party depends on the security of its
corresponding underlying ledger, the security resilience
of the overlay protocol now dictates the number of well
behaved underlying ledgers required.
If $\Pi$ has $\frac{1}{2}$ resilience and the majority of underlying
ledgers are secure, then the emulated execution of $\Pi$ is also secure.
This gives life to a new kind of roll-up, which stands on top of multiple
layer-1s, making it more secure than any of them individually.

\begin{conjecture}[Security]
  Let $\Pi$ be a distributed ledger protocol, and $\frac{t}{n}$ be its resilience such
  that if $f < t$, where $f$ is the number of adversarial parties, and $n$ is the total number of parties,
  then for all PPT adversaries, an execution of $\Pi$ is secure with overwhelming probability.

  The execution of $\recursiveConsensus_{\Pi}$ is secure if $f < t$, where $n - f$ of the
  underlying ledgers are guaranteed to be secure with overwhelming probability.

% \begin{corollary}[Safety]
%       Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a weighted set of transcribable Distributed Ledger Protocols,
%       and $\Pi$ be a soft-deterministic State Machine Replication protocol.
%       Consider a rollerblade constructed with $\Pi$ as a blade and
%       $\mathcal{L}$ as its wheels.
%       Consider a rollerblade execution in which the weighted majority of $\mathcal{L}$
%       is secure.
%       Then the rollerblade is safe.
