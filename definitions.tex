\subsection{The Setting}

We are given $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ledger protocols
$\Y[][1], \Y[][2], \ldots, \Y[][i], \ldots, \Y[][n]$,
the so-called \emph{underlying} ledger protocols.
While mathematically, these $\Y$s are interactive Turing machines of ledger protocols,
in practice, these are preexisting, already operational ledger protocol executions
such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano, for which we have access to already running full nodes
and we are asked to compose on top of.

We are also given a distributed protocol $\Pi$ (not necessarily a ledger protocol),
the so-called \emph{overlay} protocol. We will simulate an $n$-party execution of $\Pi$,
with each $i$ of these $n$ parties corresponding to the underlying ledger protocol $\Y[][i]$.

The users of the protocol are $m \in \mathbb{N}$ \rollerblade \emph{clients} termed
$\RB[1], \RB[2], \ldots, \RB[j], \ldots, \RB[m]$ (with, potentially $m \neq n$).
\emph{Each} $\RB[j]$ client runs a separate full node $\Y[j][1], \ldots, \Y[j][i], \ldots, \Y[j][n]$
for each of the underlying $\Y$s. The $\RB$ nodes do not have direct network communication, but only
use the read/write functionalities of their respective $\Y$ instances to communicate.
For example, when party $\RB[1]$ \emph{writes} a transaction $\tx$ to its $\Y[1][1]$ instance,
this transaction will eventually appear in $\RB[2]$'s $\Y[2][1]$ instance ledger output,
as long as $\Y[][1]$ is live.
We will use $\Ledger[j][i][r] \gets \Y[j][i][r].\lread()$ to refer to the ledger reported at
round $r$ by the full node instance $\Y[j][i]$ running the underlying ledger protocol $\Y[][i]$
operated by the overlay party $\RB[j]$
(this ledger, like all ledgers, is a sequence of round/transaction pairs, and its
$k^\text{th}$ round/transaction pair is $\Ledger[j][i][r][k]$).

%
% TODO: move this to consensus section
% Our goal is to build a \emph{new} DLP $\RB$
% on top of these such that, if the majority of \emph{underlying}
% $\wheel[1], \ldots, \wheel[n]$ are \emph{secure}, then so is the
% \emph{overlay} DLP $\RB$. As $\RB$ is a DLP, it will have its own population of $m$ nodes
% $\RB_1, \RB_2, \ldots, \RB_m$. The $\RB$ DLP will have its own type of transaction and a
% ledger consisting of these transactions. For example, it can maintain its own coin\footnote{
% We will not be concerned with bridging this coin from the overlay ledger to the underlying
% ledgers. This can be done using various standard bridging techniques which are orthogonal
% to this work~\cite{pow-sidechains,pos-sidechains,zkbridge}.}. Importantly, similarly to
% a rollup, \emph{we will not make any additional security assumptions about the honesty of the
% $\RB$ nodes}.
%

We now describe the requirements of our underlying and overlay protocols.

\subsection{Rollerblade Underlying Requirements}

Firstly, in order to record data on our underlying ledgers, we require that any arbitrary string
can be written to them. This is called a \emph{bulletin}.

\paragraph{Bulletins}
% We do not want to modify the underlying DLPs to support our protocol. However, the underlying DLPs
% do not understand the transaction semantics of our overlay ledger. We will therefore use the underlying
% DLPs as a simple lazy transaction ordering service. We will assume that we can take any
% arbitrary string $w$ and \emph{encode} it into a transaction suitable for each underlying ledger.
% Such transactions are \emph{always} accepted by the underlying ledger, and their contents
% are not validated (beyond checking that a minimum fee is suitably paid to avoid spamming attacks).
% We call a DLP that supports writing such arbitrary data into it a \emph{bulletin}.
A bulletin ledger protocol offers two additional
functions $\encode$ and $\decode$:
$\tx \gets \textsf{encode}(s)$ and $s \gets \textsf{decode}(\tx)$.
The $\textsf{encode}$ function takes a string $s$ and encodes it into a transaction $\tx$ that can be \emph{written}
into the ledger and is guaranteed to be accepted.
The $\textsf{decode}$ function takes a transaction $\tx$
and, if it is a bulletin transaction, decodes it back into $s$.
Otherwise, $\textsf{decode}$ can return $\bot$.
All transactions produced by $\textsf{encode}$
are bulletin transactions, but the adversary can also introduce arbitrary bulletin transactions of her choice
indiscriminately. The ledger may also include non-bulletin transactions among the bulletin transactions.

\begin{definition}[Bulletin Board]
  A ledger protocol $\Pi$ accompanied by a pair of computable
  functions $(\encode, \decode)$, of which $\decode$ is deterministic,
  is called a \emph{bulletin board} if it holds that, for any $s \in \{0, 1\}^*$,
  the output of $\tx = \encode(s)$ is always a valid
  transaction and that $\decode(\encode(s)) = s$.
\end{definition}

Bulletins provide ordering and data availability of arbitrary data without checking
any semantic validity. As such, they constitute a \emph{lazy} use of a ledger~\cite{lazyledger,lazylight}.
All popular blockchains such as, for example, Ethereum and Bitcoin are bulletins.
Bitcoin allows the recording of arbitrary data using \textsf{OP\_RETURN}
transactions, whereas Ethereum allows such recording by including the
data in the \textsf{CALLDATA} of a smart contract call, or in the parameters
of an event.

\paragraph{Certifiability}

% TODO: generalize from certificates to transcriptions
% TODO: clean up this definition
\begin{definition}[Certifiability]
  A ledger protocol $\Pi$ accompanied by a computable functionality $\transcribe$
  and a computable deterministic (non-interactive) function $\untranscribe$ is called
  \emph{certifiable}. The functionality $\transcribe$ is called on a full node
  and returns a \emph{transcription} of its current ledger. The function
  $\untranscribe$ is called with the transcription as the parameter,
  and is hoped to return the original ledger.
  The certifiable protocol is \emph{live}
  % TODO: Can we unify this definition of liveness/safety with the ledger protocol
  % using one definition for both?
  if, in addition to the liveness requirements of the ledger protocol,
  whenever $\transcribe()$ is called on an honest
  party $P$ with a ledger $L$ and returns a transcription $\tau$,
  then $\untranscribe(\tau) = L$.

  % TODO: I don't like that this talks about "whenever" untranscribe is called...
  % it might be called incorrectly? Also this seems kind of internal to the construction...
  The certifiable protocol is \emph{safe}
  if,
  in addition to the safety requirements of the ledger protocol,
  whenever an honest party $P_1$ executes $\untranscribe(\tau)$ at round $r_1$
  with some (honestly or adversarially produced) transcription $\tau$,
  then for all honest parties $P_2$ at round $r_2$, it holds that

  \[
    \Ledger[P_1][][r_1] \preceq \Ledger[P_2][][r_2] \lor
    \Ledger[P_2][][r_2] \preceq \Ledger[P_1][][r_1]
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[\rollerblade-Suitable Underlying Protocol]
  A \emph{distributed protocol} is called a \emph{\rollerblade-Suitable
  Underlying Protocol} if it is a
  (potentially permissionless)
  distributed temporal ledger protocol
  which is a bulletin board and a
  certifiable protocol.
\end{definition}

In summary, the underlying ledgers provide the following functionalities:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{construct}: Initializes the protocol.
  \item \textbf{execute}: Executes one round of the protocol.
  \item \textbf{write}: Writes a transaction to the ledger. The transaction
        appears within $u$ rounds if the ledger protocol is \emph{live}.
  \item \textbf{read}: Reads the temporal ledger. The ledger read is
        consistent with whatever other honest parties are reading if the
        ledger protocol is \emph{safe}, and the transactions appear with
        correct recorded rounds if the protocol is \emph{timely}.
  \item \textbf{encode}: Given an arbitrary string, produces a valid bulletin transaction.
  \item \textbf{decode}: Given a bulletin transaction, produces the original
        string used to encode it.
  \item \textbf{transcribe}: Produces a transcription $\tau$ of the
        current temporal ledger.
  \item \textbf{untranscribe}: Given a transcription $\tau$, produces a ledger
        promised to be \emph{safe} and \emph{live} as compared to the
        rest of the honest parties.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Overlay Requirements}

Our construction allows running \emph{any} deterministic
overlay permissioned distributed protocol
working over authenticated channels.

% TODO: write out the execution environment...
\begin{definition}[\rollerblade-Suitable Overlay Protocol]
  A distributed protocol is called \emph{\rollerblade-Suitable Overlay Protocol}
  if it is deterministic and permissioned.
\end{definition}
