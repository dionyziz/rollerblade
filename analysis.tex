      Definition of transcribility...

\begin{definition}[Soft Determinism]
      Let $\Pi^\Sigma$ be a State Machine Replication protocol that makes
      oracle use of a signature protocol $\Sigma = (\textsf{Gen}, \textsf{Sig}, \textsf{Ver})$.
      The protocol $\Pi$ is called \emph{soft deterministic} if,
      when executed as an interactive turing machine $\Pi^\Sigma(i)$ initialized for party
      with index $i$, the machine does not make use of any local randomness.
\end{definition}

The above definition still allows for use of randomness within the $\Sigma$ protocol of the
signature, which captures the functionality of generating keys, signing, and verifying
messages. Typical BFT protocols such as Streamlet~\cite{streamlet} and Hot Stuff~\cite{hotstuff}
satisfy the \emph{soft determinism} definition.

\begin{definition}[Authenticated Communication Protocol]
      An Authenticated Communication Protocol ACP is...
      Define what is the syntax of $\Sigma$... (and maybe use a different letter)
      ... TODO
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Peer-to-Peer ACP]
      Make an ACP by composing an existentially unforgeable signature scheme and
      a synchronous network... TODO
\end{definition}

\begin{conjecture}[Similarity]
      Consider any SMR protocol $\Pi$, and let $\Sigma^S$ be a
      Peer-to-Peer ACP. Consider $\Sigma^\mathrm{RB}$ to be the RollerBlade
      ACP constructed using some DLPs... TODO

      TODO: How do we model the fact that RB is running multiple instances
      each simulating multiple parties inside?...

      For any adversary $\mathcal{A}$ and any number of parties $n$,
      there is a simulator $\mathcal{S}$ such that
      for any environment $\mathcal{Z}$,
      the following two distributions
      are computationally indistinguishable:

      \[
            \textsc{View}^{\mathcal{Z},\mathcal{S},\Pi,\Sigma^S}_{\mathcal{Z}}(1^\lambda, n)
            \simeq_c
            \textsc{View}^{\mathcal{Z},\mathcal{A},\Pi,\Sigma^\mathrm{RB}}_{\mathcal{Z}}(1^\lambda, n)
      \]
\end{conjecture}
\begin{proof}
      How do we prevent the adversary from looking at the substrate of signatures?
      It seems that we may have to use an abstract functionality here... TODO
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Safety]
      Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a weighted set of transcribable Distributed Ledger Protocols,
      and $\Pi$ be a soft-deterministic State Machine Replication protocol.
      Consider a rollerblade constructed with $\Pi$ as a blade and
      $\mathcal{L}$ as its wheels.
      Consider a rollerblade execution in which the weighted majority of $\mathcal{L}$
      is secure.
      Then the rollerblade is safe.

\begin{corollary}[Liveness]
      Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a weighted set of transcribable Distributed Ledger Protocols,
      and $\Pi$ be a soft-deterministic State Machine Replication protocol.
      Consider a rollerblade constructed with $\Pi$ as a blade and
      $\mathcal{L}$ as its wheels.
      Consider a rollerblade execution in which the weighted majority of $\mathcal{L}$
      is secure.
      Then the rollerblade is live.
