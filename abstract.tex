\begin{abstract}
  Distributed system protocols are often designed on top of
  \emph{authenticated channels} in which participants are assumed
  to be able to communicate with each other in an untamperable manner.
  In this paper, we observe that most such protocols can be rewritten
  by replacing a \emph{party} with a \emph{ledger} (such as
  a blockchain system) and the communication between parties with
  cross-chain light clients. This transform is useful because
  blockchain systems are always online and have battle-tested
  security assumptions.
  We posit a \emph{metatheorem} that allows transforming many theorems from the \emph{party}
  setting into theorems in the \emph{ledger} setting, while preserving
  analogies between party \emph{honesty} and ledger \emph{security}.
  Next, we use our transform to instantiate our protocol by running a blockchain protocol
  on top of other blockchain protocols, treating the underlying blockchains
  as parties in the overlay protocol. This enables us to create a layer-2 rollup
  that sits on top of multiple chains and is more reliable than the underlying
  layer-1s: If the security of a minority of the underlying layer-1 blockchains fails,
  the layer-2's security is maintained.
