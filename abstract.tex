\begin{abstract}
A required assumption to prove safety and liveness of distributed ledger protocols
is the \emph{honest majority assumption}, whether it is by compute (in Proof-of-Work),
by money (in Proof-of-Stake), or by count (in permissioned systems). If the assumption
is violated, safety and liveness can fail. In today's multi-chain world, some chains
enjoy long-term security because their resource remains in honest hands, while other
chains fail, not because their protocol is subpar, but because their population has
dwindled and their honest majority assumption no longer holds. It is not always easy
to predict which chains will remain secure \emph{a priori}. In this paper, we put
forth \emph{rollerblade}, a construction of a distributed ledger protocol on \emph{top
} of
\emph{multiple} existing distributed ledger protocols. The designer of the rollerblade can
choose to deploy it on top of whichever underlying ledger protocols she desires.
The security guarantees that we provide are that the resulting protocol is safe
and live as long as the (weighted) majority of the underlying protocols are safe
and live.
