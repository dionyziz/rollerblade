\begin{abstract}
  We observe that most fixed-party distributed protocols can be rewritten
  by replacing a \emph{party} with a \emph{ledger} (such as
  a blockchain system) and the authenticated channel communication between parties with
  cross-chain relayers. This transform is useful because
  blockchain systems are always online and have battle-tested
  security assumptions.
  We provide a definitional framework that captures this analogy.
  We model the transform formally,
  and posit and prove a generic \emph{metatheorem} that allows translating all theorems from the \emph{party}
  setting into theorems in the \emph{emulated} setting, while preserving
  analogies between party \emph{honesty} and ledger \emph{security}.
  In the heart of our proof lies a reduction-based simulation argument.
  As an example, our metatheorem can be used to construct
  a consensus protocol on top of other blockchains,
  creating a reliable rollup that assumes only the majority
  of the underlying layer-1s are secure.
