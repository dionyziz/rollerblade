\appsection[Acknowledgements]

The authors wish to thank Joachim Neu for helping discover
the necessity of transcribability and certifiability of ledgers to achieve
different assurances in the virtualized world,
as well as the relationship between safety failures of ledgers
and rollback corruptions of simulated parties.
We also thank Ertem Nusret Tas, Kostis Karantias, and
Srivatsan Sridhar for the insightful discussions during the development of this
project.

This paper and the concurrent related work in which blockchains were analyzed
as ``circuits''~\cite{circuits} both came out of many fruitful discussions about
blockchain composability among Ertem Nusret Tas, David Tse, and Dionysis Zindros, when
they were all at Stanford University.
