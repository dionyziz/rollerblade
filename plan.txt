- Verbal/written and transcribability/certifiability table
  * Where does TrustBoost stand in this?
- Formalize notion of verbal/written communication
- Rework algorithm to modularize role of "Rollerblade",
  and of the overlay ledger protocol.
- State conjectures in the form of UC
  * "Verbal communication" can be replaced with an underlying ledger
  * "Written communication" can be replaced with an underlying ledger
  * => Streamlet on top of verbal communication realized as an underlying
       ledger has full ledger functionality
- "Known origin oracle"
- "Transferable origin oracle"
