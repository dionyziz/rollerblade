\begin{conjecture}[Security]
  TODO: Write security conjecture for any consensus $\Pi$ ran on top of Rollerblade
\end{conjecture}

% \begin{corollary}[Safety]
%       Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a weighted set of transcribable Distributed Ledger Protocols,
%       and $\Pi$ be a soft-deterministic State Machine Replication protocol.
%       Consider a rollerblade constructed with $\Pi$ as a blade and
%       $\mathcal{L}$ as its wheels.
%       Consider a rollerblade execution in which the weighted majority of $\mathcal{L}$
%       is secure.
%       Then the rollerblade is safe.

% \begin{corollary}[Liveness]
%       Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a weighted set of transcribable Distributed Ledger Protocols,
%       and $\Pi$ be a soft-deterministic State Machine Replication protocol.
%       Consider a rollerblade constructed with $\Pi$ as a blade and
%       $\mathcal{L}$ as its wheels.
%       Consider a rollerblade execution in which the weighted majority of $\mathcal{L}$
%       is secure.
%       Then the rollerblade is live.
